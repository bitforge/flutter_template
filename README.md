# flutter_template

A template project for new Bitforge Flutter apps.

Maybe the best way to start a new mobile app project in the world. 🚀 🌑 ➡️ 🌕 🥂 🥇

👍 Main-Goal: Start new and extendable Flutter Apps quickly.
👎 Non-Goal: A jack of all trades: This is not a framework!

It's intentionally kept light both in code size & pub dependencies.
I've you wanna share code across projects, consider creating a library instead.

Features:

- Quick Setup including app name & identifier, app icon, splashscreen etc.
- [Riverpod Architecture](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-app-architecture-riverpod-introduction/) inspired by [@bizz84](https://github.com/bizz84)
- [Modular App Structure](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-project-structure/) aka Feature-First
- [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) base theme with dark mode support
- [go_router](https://pub.dev/documentation/go_router/latest/index.html) with bottom navigation & deep linking support
- [riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) basic examples for StateNotifier & dependency injection
- [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) based REST API example for cute [shibe](https://shibe.online) images
- [share_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/share_plus) for sharing doge images
- [easy_localization](https://pub.dev/packages/easy_localization) translation ready
- [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) to open browser links on all platforms
- [app_settings](https://pub.dev/packages/app_settings) to change language via system settings
